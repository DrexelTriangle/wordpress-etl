<strong>Past Presences</strong>

Powelton Village has been positively impacted by an artist who has recently past away into the big blue yonder. Randy Dalton, a Resident Artist of the Community Education Center (CEC), has brought an aesthetic, sustaining presence into the area with his involvement in the CEC and project <em>Blue Grotto</em>.

John Alessi and Fran Olivieri, both '85 Penn Alumni, remember volunteering in the CEC with the Grass Roots Alliance for a Solar Pennsylvania when they were students in West Philadelphia, and enjoyed working under Randy &amp; the CEC.

Randy's presence as a building manager is being remembered with the continued showing of his project, <em>Blue Grotto</em> in the basement of the CEC.<em> </em>The CEC's vibrant presence of projects continues through the various creations of current artists in residence and education classes. Check out there website, or stop by the CEC on 3500 Lancaster Avenue.
